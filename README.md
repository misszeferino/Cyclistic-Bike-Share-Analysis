# Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis

## Introduction
This case study is the capstone project of the [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics?utm_source=google&utm_medium=institutions&utm_campaign=gwgsite&_ga=2.129757833.403704245.1637397436-146999043.1637397436). In this case study, we will perform data analysis for a fictional bike-share company to help them attract more riders.

## Objective

Our objective for this analysis is to draw insights from the available data that demonstrates how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently in the last 12 months. Additionally, we have to provide a summary of our analysis with supporting visualizations and three recommendations based on our analysis.
